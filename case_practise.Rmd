```{r}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

load the data
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data(nyc_airbnb) 
```

View the data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nyc_airbnb %>%  View
```

clean and rename something
```{r}
nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(starts = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(boro, neighbourhood)
```

## Some questions

* Does rating vary by neighbourhood, room type, or both?
* How is price related to other variables?
* Where are rentals located?

* What's the most expensive area? What about the least?
* Which listings have the most unfilled days?
* Which area has the highest density of listings?
* What are some host characteristics? How many listings? What's associated with rating?
